**Read first:** `results/hippo_route/RESULTS.md`, `results/life/RESULTS.md`.

### Findings
1. **Store-alone baseline (new, `hippo_probe.py`).** Nearest-prototype readout of the same
   ProtoStore, no network: MNIST 91.6 (9/class) / 94.2 (40/class) final class-IL, never
   forgets; Fashion 77.0 / 80.1. FF + sleep on the same store: 89.3 / 91.0 MNIST, 78.48 Fashion
   best. **The cortex is at or below its own hippocampus.** Store is hopeless at the label
   swap (3–14%) where FF adapts in 500 examples.
2. **Life headroom bound (from `results/life`, bg 0.2, 16 days).** Sleep can only improve
   off-season answers: max gain = off_share × (1 − off_season acc) = 0.134 × 0.185 ≈ 2.5
   points of lifetime accuracy. Clock sleep pays 8.7 in misses, so it loses by construction;
   circadian pays 1.0 and gained **0.0** off-season (81.6 vs 81.6). Pressure / two-process
   triggers never fired (0 sleeps). The 20% background is itself interleaved replay, done by the
   world. Lowering bg doesn't fix it: forgotten classes become rarer at the same rate they are
   forgotten (bg 0.02 smoke: never-sleep 92.6 vs circadian 92.1). Prequential lifetime accuracy
   weights memories by how often they're queried, and the same frequency rehearses them.
3. **Varied replay (`results/varied`, finals only; anytime/recent share lost to the Mac crash,
   VPS rerun in progress).** Under awake replay 0.8: 83.0 → 85.9 (jitter 2 px) → 88.7 (40
   protos). Without awake replay: jitter 90.2, 40 protos 91.0. Supports the memorisation
   hypothesis on the final score; anytime + recent share still needed.
4. **Slow waking is not free in a life.** Life: wake lr ×0.3 costs −1.0 lifetime, novel
   first-300 74 → 61, swap first-300 78 → 54 (two-process). Audit item 2 (make ×0.3 the
   default) should wait.

### Literature insight
CLS (McClelland, McNaughton & O'Reilly 1995) has the hippocampus **answer** recent items
directly while the neocortex learns slowly; replay is only half its job. Kumaran, Hassabis &
McClelland 2016 (TICS, "What learning systems do intelligent agents need?") add that replay
should be weighted by relevance, not uniform. pdp only uses the store to train the net, never to
respond, which is why slow waking looks costly in the life (finding 4) and why the net trails
its own store (finding 1). In our system the store is the *stable* side and FF the *plastic*
side, the reverse of the textbook assignment.

### Paths closed / demoted
- "FF + sleep reaches 90% class-IL" as evidence for the *network*: demoted. Must be reported
  against store-alone at equal memory from now on.
- Tuning sleep triggers on the current life world: closed until the world gives memory value
  (finding 2). Prediction (a) of the audit can't be decided there.

### Hypotheses, ranked
1. **Architecture (dual route), test next.** Answer with the store when its nearest-prototype
   margin is high or the class is novel; answer with FF otherwise; a per-class running
   agreement score arbitrates. Prediction: lifetime ≥ never-sleep 94.1 *and* Split-MNIST final
   ≥ 91.6 (store-alone), with swap adaptation ≥ 85. Kill: if the router can't beat the better
   of its two routes by ≥0.5.
2. **Data (world).** Give memory value: long absences (bg ≤ 0.02, seasons of 1–2 digits) plus a
   "returns" score on the first 50 inputs of a digit back after ≥ 10k ticks, reported
   separately from lifetime. Prediction: night sleep beats never-sleep on returns by ≥ 10.
   (life.py already has a RET_GAP returns counter; use it.)
3. **Training algorithm.** Replace replay-to-distil with replay of the store's *errors relative
   to the net*: replay only prototypes the net misclassifies (cheap, uses the awake probe).
   Prediction: same final at ≤ 0.3× replay. Kill: final drops > 1.
4. **Neuron.** Two-compartment FF unit whose apical input is the store's retrieved label
   (hippocampal context, not the true label). Prediction: anytime ≥ 85 with clock 2000.
   Blocked behind 1.
5. **Store adaptation.** Swap shows the store's 1/n rate freezes it. Let the cortex's confident
   disagreement (FF right, store wrong, repeatedly for a class) reset that slot's count. Ties to
   the open "change detector" direction.
